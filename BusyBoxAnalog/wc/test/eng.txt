Now we are able to find our files, but we might need more meta information about what is in those files. Let's implement a wc-like utility to gather basic statistics about our files.
First things first, let's assume our files are utf-8 encoded text files, so your code should work with texts in Russian, too (forget about special cases like Arabic for now, only English and Russian are required). Also, you may ignore punctuation and just consider spaces as the only word delimiters.
You'll need to implement three mutually exclusive (only one can be specified at a time, otherwise an error message is printed) flags for your code: -l for counting lines, -m for counting characters and -w for counting words. Your program should be runnable like this:
As you may see, the answer is always a calculated number and a filename separated by tab (\t). If no flags are specified, -w behaviour should be used.
Important: as all files are independent, you should utilize goroutines to process them concurrently. You can start as many goroutines as there are input files specified for the program.
